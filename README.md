# **Ising Model Simulation using Monte Carlo Method**

This project implements the **2D Ising Model** using the **Metropolis Algorithm** to study phase transitions in statistical mechanics. The simulation measures **magnetization, energy, and specific heat** as a function of temperature.

---

## **Methodology**
- The **Metropolis algorithm** is used to update spin configurations.
- The system is a **square lattice** with periodic boundary conditions.
- Energy and magnetization are computed at each Monte Carlo step.
- Thermal equilibrium is reached over multiple iterations.

## **Files Included**
- `ising.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing the simulation.
