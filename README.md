# **Ising Model Simulation using Monte Carlo Method**

This project implements the **2D Ising Model** using the **Metropolis Algorithm** to study phase transitions in statistical mechanics. The simulation measures **magnetization, energy, and specific heat** as a function of temperature.

---

## **Methodology**
- The **Metropolis algorithm** is used to update spin configurations.
- The system is a **square lattice** with periodic boundary conditions.
- Energy and magnetization are computed at each Monte Carlo step.
- Thermal equilibrium is reached over multiple iterations.

---

## **Files Included**
- `ising.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook containing the simulation.
---

## **How to Run**
1. Download `ising.ipynb` from this repository.
2. Open it in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
3. Run all cells to perform the simulation.
4. Modify parameters such as:
   - Lattice size (`L`)
   - Temperature range
   - Number of Monte Carlo steps
